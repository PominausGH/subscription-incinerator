### LinkedIn Strategy (Marketers)
- **Content pillars:** Conversion optimization tips, urgency psychology, landing page best practices
- **Post frequency:** 3-4x per week
- **Format mix:** Text posts (60%), carousels (30%), short videos (10%)
- **Soft CTA:** Link to TimerForge in comments, not main post (LinkedIn algorithm penalizes external links)
- **Outreach:** Connect with marketing managers, growth hackers, e-commerce founders - engage with their content before pitching

### Twitter/YouTube Strategy (Content Creators)
- **Twitter:** Share quick tips on stream overlays, video countdowns, engagement tricks. Use relevant hashtags (#ContentCreator, #StreamerTips, #YouTuber)
- **YouTube:** Create 2-3 tutorial videos: "How to Add Countdown Timers to Your Stream", "Create Urgency on Sales Pages", "TimerForge vs Free Alternatives"
- **Engagement:** Reply to creators asking about timer solutions in comments/threads

### Quick Wins
- Product Hunt launch (free, high visibility)
- Post in r/SaaS, r/marketing, r/Entrepreneur with genuine value-first approach

## Section 2: FakeCallApp Promotion Strategy

**Primary Channels:** Play Store ASO + Reddit + TikTok/Instagram Reels

### Play Store ASO (App Store Optimization)
- **Keywords:** Target "fake call", "prank call app", "fake incoming call", "escape call" in title and description
- **Screenshots:** Show realistic call screens, customization options, schedule feature
- **Icon:** Clean, recognizable - stands out in search results
- **Reviews:** Prompt happy users to rate (in-app after positive interactions)
- **Localization:** Translate listing to Spanish, Portuguese, Hindi for bigger markets

### Reddit Strategy
- **Subreddits:** r/androidapps, r/apps, r/pranks, r/socialskills, r/anxiety (escape awkward situations angle)
- **Approach:** Don't spam - answer questions like "any good fake call apps?" genuinely
- **Post format:** "I built this app to help people escape awkward situations" - storytelling works

### Short-Form Video (TikTok/Instagram Reels)
- **Content:** Funny skits showing use cases - escaping bad dates, boring meetings, family gatherings
- **Style:** Relatable humor, trending sounds
- **CTA:** "Link in bio" to Play Store
- **Frequency:** 2-3 reels per week, repurpose across platforms

### Budget Allocation
- $30-50/month on Google Ads (App campaigns) targeting high-intent keywords

**Status:** Waiting for user feedback - focus on validation and building waitlist

### LinkedIn Thought Leadership (Primary)

- **Post types:** "I reviewed 500 CVs last month - here's what I learned", polls about hiring struggles, hot takes on recruitment
- **Goal:** Build authority so when you launch, audience is primed

### Validation Activities
- **DM outreach:** Message HR managers, recruiters, startup founders asking about their CV screening process
- **Problem interviews:** "What's your biggest frustration when reviewing applications?"
- **Collect emails:** Simple landing page with "Get early access" - use Carrd or Notion (free)

### Soft Launch Prep
- **Beta testers:** Offer free consulting sessions to 5-10 people in exchange for feedback and testimonials
- **Case studies:** Document results - "Helped Company X reduce screening time by 60%"
- **Pricing research:** Ask what they'd pay, test different price points

- **Frequency:** 2-3 tweets per week about development journey
- **Engagement:** Follow and interact with other indie hackers - community supports each other

### Content Angles
- **Problem-focused posts:** "The average person wastes $200/month on forgotten subscriptions"
- **Behind the scenes:** Tech stack decisions, design iterations, user research
- **Milestones:** "Just hit 100 email signups", "Stripe integration done"

### Early Traction Channels
